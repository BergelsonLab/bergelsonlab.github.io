      Abstract
     </h4>
     <p>
      Around 12 months, infants have well-specified phonetic representations of familiar nouns. They detect consonant and vowel mispronunciations during comprehension (Swingley &amp; Aslin 2000; Mani &amp; Plunkett 2007, 2008; Bergelson &amp; Swingley, 2017); sensitivity by 18 months is even more robust (Swingley &amp; Aslin 2000; White &amp; Morgan, 2008). However, we know little about early phonetic representations of verbs.
Verbs are cross-linguistically later-learned than concrete nouns (Gentner, 1982). Indeed, 3-year-olds still struggle with novel verbs in the lab; tense-marking acquisition extends into middle childhood (Maguire, Hirsh-Pasek, &amp; Golinkoff, 2005; Herriot, 1969). Still, infants begin producing verbs around 18 months. How robust are early phonological representations of verbs, and does verb regularity play a role?
