      Abstract
     </h4>
     <p>
      We consider the role of infants’ pre-linguistic vocalizations in
  relation to caregiver input. We analyze a cross-sectional sample
  to investigate whether early production is driven by infants’
  perception of segments matching their own phonological
  capacity. We analyzed 44 infants’ consonant productions from
  an hour of home-recorded video data taken at 10-11 months.
  Each consonant the infant produced was transcribed, alongside
  any acoustically salient word produced by the caregiver in
  the preceding 15s. We coded whether infants’ consonant
  productions were phonetically congruent with caregiver input
  (e.g. mother says ‘ball’ 5s before infant produces /bə/).
  Compared with scrambled parental-production data, the
  proportion of parent-matching infant productions was
  significantly above chance. Furthermore, infants with more
  stable consonant productions (‘vocal motor schemes’)
  responded with congruent consonants significantly more
  often if that consonant was established in their phonological
  inventory. These findings have implications for understanding
  early lexical learning in the context of the perception-production
  interface.
