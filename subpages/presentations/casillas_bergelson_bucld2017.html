      Abstract
     </h4>
     <p>
      <p>
       While previous research has demonstrated the variability
in CDS cross-culturally, and within and across SES groups,
broader characterizations of CDS across age and demographic
variables are lacking. Here we characterize CDS using
naturalistic daylong recordings from 61 families in North
America across a broad age-range, child/caregiver gender, and
SES.
      </p>
      <p>
       We find that North American infants hear roughly 60% of
their input in a register that is hand-tailored to them over their
first two years, with ~75% of this input coming from female
adults. The proportion of CDS infants hear increases with age,
but more so for female talkers than male talkers. SES further
modulates the quantities of overall speech and CDS, while
child gender plays little role in our findings. Our results provide
evidence for which demographic variables predict CDS; this
in turn allows mechanistic proposals of how input influences
language abilities, over time.
