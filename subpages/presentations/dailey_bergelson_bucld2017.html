      Abstract
     </h4>
     <p>
      Gender differences in language abilities start in infancy and persist over time, yet the
	development of these differences, and the factors that underlie them, are poorly
	understood. The present study investigated whether male and female infants hear
	different input, as a function of their own word production and age. We combined both
	input and production data within a single set of infants longitudinally, spanning the
	typical onset of word production. 44 infants were recorded at home from 6-17 months,
	and child-directed and child-produced object words were analyzed. Overall, girls talked
	more and exhibited larger lexical diversity. However, we found no gender differences in
	input (types or tokens) before or after word production began, or overall. We explore the
	implications of our results, which suggest an underappreciated biological component
	(surely paired with environmental influences) in this early gender difference in lexical
	development.
