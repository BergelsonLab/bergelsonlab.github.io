   DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY IN OUR LAB
  </h2>
 </center>
 <p>
  The Bergelson Lab is committed to providing mentorship and fostering a lab environment that is safe and inclusive of people from all backgrounds. We aim to diversify the lab and support scholars of color and those from underrepresented backgrounds. For example, we use skill-based, equitable hiring practices, create channels of peer support, and encourage open feedback.
