                        <p>Elika Bergelson is the Principal Investigator for the SEEDLingS project. She is excited to be doing this work within the Rochester Babylab, thanks to an <a href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/earlyindependence/index">NIH Early Independence Award</a>.</p>
                        <p>Elika received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where she first became interested in infant word-learning, after strong research training at the University of Maryland as a <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/baggett/">Baggett Fellow</a>, and at NYU. Her training is in psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science and she thinks figuring out how babies learn language is just about the coolest question out there.</p>
                  <p>After SEEDLingS data collection ends, the Bergelson lab will be moving to Duke University.</p>

<p>After SEEDLingS, Shaelise will be continuing her Graduate Program in Marriage and Family Therapy at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry as a full-time student. She will begin her two practicum placements this summer at Strong Behavioral Health and one of the Hillside Family of Agencies sites and graduate next August.</p>
  <p>Long-term, she still plans to work with young children and families in multiple settings, doing both prevention and intervention work. Short-term, when she is not in class over the next year, she plans on watching her husband coach soccer games and working on her list of books that has been steadily growing for the past year and a half!</p>
