   The Bergelson Lab (aka
   <b>
    BLAB
   </b>
   ) is a part of the
   <a href="https://www.harvardlds.org/">
    Laboratory for Developmental Studies
   </a>
   group within the
   <a href="https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/">
    Department of Psychology
   </a>
   at Harvard University. We are located on the 11th floor at William James Hall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We study infant word learning, in particular how infantsâ€™ early linguistic and environmental input plays a role in their learning. We focus on understanding how babies learn words from the visual, social, and linguistic world around them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BLAB moved to Harvard from Duke University in 2023.
						And it moved to Duke in 2016 from the University of Rochester, where it finished data collection in July 2016 for a longitudinal study called
