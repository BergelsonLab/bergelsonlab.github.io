      ). Dr. Bergelson received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where she first became interested in infant word-learning, after receiving research training at the University of Maryland as a
      <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/baggett/">
       Baggett Fellow
      </a>
      , and a B.A. at NYU in Language and Mind. Her training is in psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science. Before coming to Harvard, she was a postdoc and then research prof at URochester's Brain &amp; CogSci Dept, and then a professor in Duke's Psych &amp; Neuro Dept. Dr. Bergelson's work has been funded by the NSF and NIH; she is the recipient of an NIH Early Independence Award and R01, and an NSF CAREER Award. Dr. Bergelson thinks figuring out how babies learn language is just about the coolest question out there.
