Dr. Bergelson received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where she first became interested in infant word-learning, after receiving research training at the University of Maryland as a <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/baggett/">Baggett Fellow</a>, and a B.A. at NYU in Language and Mind. Her training is in psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science. Most recently she was a Research Professor at the University of Rochester's Brain and CogSci Department. Dr. Bergelson's work has been funded by the NSF and NIH; she is most recently the recipient of an NIH Early Independence Award. Dr. Bergelson thinks figuring out how babies learn language is just about the coolest question out there.

In college, Halden plans to double major in Anthropology with a focus on Global Health and Neuroscience with a focus on Child Development, as well as minor in Chinese Language and Culture. In her free time, Halden loves to run, bike, plank, read and write poetry and Chinese, play boccia with her older brother, and experiment with oatmeal.
