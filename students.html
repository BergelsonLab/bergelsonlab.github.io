        <center><h2>DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY IN OUR LAB</h2></center>
        <p>
          The Bergelson Lab is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment and welcomes scholars of all backgrounds. <br><br>
          We seek to recruit undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-docs from historically underrepresented communities and disparate and nontraditional academic backgrounds. We are committed to nurturing all lab members with a supportive and understanding community. In particular, we are committed to bringing transparency and openness to the "hidden curriculum" -- unofficial norms, behaviors, and values of the university.
</p>

<br><br>
<center><h2>FOR INTERESTED STUDENTS</h2></center>

				<p>
					The Bergelson Lab is always happy to hear from interested potential research assistants, graduate students, and postdocs.
					<br><br>
					<b>Undergraduates</b> interested in becoming research assistants should contact Lab Manager Lilli Righter at <a href="mailto:larighter@fas.harvard.edu">larighter@fas.harvard.edu</a>.
					<br><br>
					<b>Prospective graduate students or postdocs</b> can contact Dr. Bergelson at <a href="mailto:elika_bergelson@fas.harvard.edu">elika_bergelson@fas.harvard.edu</a>.

          <center><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></center>
<br>
<p>
  <b>Would my background be a good fit for the Bergelson lab?</b>
  <br>
  Students applying to join the BLab should have a particular interest in language development, psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science, particularly in the ways the environment and children's own skills contribute to language learning.
  <br><br>
  <b>What projects are happening right now?</b>
  <br>
  Currently, the lab is conducting a suite of studies exploring co-occurring and prerequisite developmental skills (predictive listening, point following, etc.) for hitting the "vocab boost," where infants' ability to learn new words rapidly improves around 12-14 months old. We will also soon begin exploring experimental methods to examine the language skills of children born blind and/or deaf. Additionally, we have a wealth of corpus data we collected at Rochester and Duke from the SEEDLingS longitudinal project and the Vision-Impaired-Hearing_Impaired (VIHI) corpus, that we are annotating and analyzing in new ways.
  <br><br>
  <b>What methods does the lab use?</b>
  <br>
  We use eyetracking (Eylink 1000 Plus), Headturn Preference Procedure, Habituation/VOE, elicitation, EEG, behavioral games, and naturalistic recording analysis.
  <br><br>
  <b>What is the mentorship structure of the lab like?</b>
  <br>
  All students, staff, and postdocs meet regularly with Dr. Bergelson to discuss their progress and the progress of their research. Additionally, undergraduate research assistants are paired with a graduate student or postdoc mentor to learn specifically about the projects their mentor is heading and contribute more deeply to a specific project. However, we also value collaboration and shared responsibility, adne veryone in the lab contributes to data collection and transcription.
  <br><br>
  <b>What skills do I need to join the BLab?</b>
    <br>
  Flexibility, deep and critical thinking, some ideas about how your research interests fit in with the lab, and a willingness to learn! Experience with experimental methods, statistical analysis, R and Python programming languages, and experience working with children are all a big plus, and are skills that you will gain or improve during your time in the BLab. You will also learn best practices for our commitments to open science and rigorous documentation.
  <br><br>
  <b>Why has no one answered my email?</b>
  <br>
  Dr. Bergelson and Lilli receive a large volume of emails from interested students, and tend to respond in waves every few weeks. We will let you know what the next steps are for your application, and if we need to set up a time to chat! Additionally, in Fall 2023, Dr. Bergelson is on maternity leave and the lab is being re-established at a new institution, so our response times are slower than usual.
  <br><br>
  <b>How does the lab uphold its commitment to open science?</b>
  <br>
  We preregister our experiments, strive for completely reproducible and publically-available analysis code, and share our stimuli and de-identifed data to approriate repositories. We also value sharing our results with the broader community, and disseminate child development science via our blog and social media. All lab members write blog posts and create TikTok videos to hone their science communication skills.
